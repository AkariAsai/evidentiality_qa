# Evidentiality-guided Generator
This is the official implementation of the following paper: Akari Asai, Matt Gardner and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. [Evidentiality-guided Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://akariasai.github.io/files/evidentiality_arxiv_2021.pdf). Preprint. 2021. 

In this paper, we introduce **Evidentiality-guidedb Geneator**, which incorporates evidentiality of passages---whether a passage contains correct evidence to support the output---into training the generator via multi-task learning of answer generation and evidentiality prediction for retrieval-augmented generation. Experimental results show large improvements across three knowledge intensive tasks: open question answering, fact verification and knowledge-enhanced dialogue.
